# reverse

## Requirements
* a single function that matches this declaration:
```C
void reverse( int arr[], unsigned int len );
```
* Array arr is of length len, and contains arbitrary integer values.
* The function should reverse the contents of the array in-place, so that on returning, the array contains the same values as before, but in the reverse order.
